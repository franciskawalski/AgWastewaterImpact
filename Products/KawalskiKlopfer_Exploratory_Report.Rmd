## Background

Water scarcity has been a growing issue for decades, especially with regards to agriculture. 2020 saw 3.2 billion people living in agricultural areas with high water scarcity per the United Nations (Water Scarcity, 2020). The UN also notes that water scarcity is projected to increase over time, an effect that–compounded with climate change–will put increasing pressure on food supplies (UN-Water, 2024). This factor is especially significant with 72% of water withdrawals globally being used for agriculture (UN-Water, 2021).

Solutions for water scarcity, therefore, are very important. One solution is the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation in agriculture, which the EPA notes can create a "reliable, sustainable, and local water supply (EPA, 2024). Reznik et al. (2019) find that the reuse of treated wastewater can be both an "Efficient and sustainable solution for water resource scarcity". However, it is not a perfect solution. The reuse of wastewater can introduce contaminants including metals, salts, and nutrients. These factors can enter and damage both soil and water supplies (Yalin et al., 2023; Trotta et al., 2024).

Among these, nutrient pollution is especially concerning. Nutrient pollution is a type of water pollution consisting of excess compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus. Per the EPA, nutrient pollution is "One of America's most widespread, costly, and challenging environmental problems," (EPA, 2024). The EPA further notes that excess nitrogen pollution can be harmful to human health and wildlife populations: excess nitrogen in bodies of surface waters can cause algae blooms, which can release toxins harmful both to humans and wildlife. Nitrates (a nitrogen compound) can enter drinking water supplies, and can be harmful to humans–or fatal to infants–even in low levels. Mosheim and Sickles (2021) find that nutrient pollution can increase the production costs of water utilities, which is substantiated by EPA findings of water production costs increasing from ten cents per gallon treated up to four dollars per gallon with the installation of a nitrate reduction system (EPA, 2024).

## Data

Our analysis aims to shed light on this trade-off between a sustainable water supply and the reduction of nutrient pollution. We use panel data from several sources to conduct our analysis. Water quality data is collected from USGS and EPA water surveys compiled by the National Water Quality Monitoring Council. This data includes concentrations of nitrogen and nitrogen compounds in various bodies of surface and groundwater in milligrams/liter. Most state regulations are for nitrogen, so we use this as our primary analysis. These observations were primarily identified by geographic coordinates, which were mapped to and averaged by U.S. state using geographic data from the Census Bureau. Some observations were linked to states using the USGS state-level office that collected the data where coordinates were not available. This data covers years from 2000 through 2023, as that time period contains most water reuse quality regulations passed by states with such regulations.

The nature and exact specifications of each state's water reuse quality regulations was collected from the EPA's Regulations and End-Use Specifications Explorer (REUSExplorer). We focused primarily on the concentration regulations on nitrogen and nitrogen compounds, specified by most states in milligrams per liter. Values from states specifying other units were converted to milligrams per liter. The year each of these regulations was registered with the EPA (or in cases where this information is not known, the most recent state-level regulation) was collected from both the EPA's REUSExplorer and each state's respective administrative code. For year of treatment, we used the year the EPA-recognized policy was established, though we also included the year in which each state first regulated wastewater reuse.

In the final dataset, the unit of analysis is called *avgvalue*, and this variable contains the average quantity of a given nitrogen compound for each state and year combination. Our analysis looks primarily at nitrogen (as opposed to other compounds thereof) as it is the most consistently regulated by states. The distribution of average value of nitrogen is right-skewed, so a log transformation was applied. For analysis and visualizations, we used log transforms on these quantities to normalize distribution and ease interpretation.

Some extreme values became apparent during the visualization process. Specifically, New Hampshire had values ten-fold higher than any other observations for the year 2015. We were unable to find any reports of this during our research, so we omitted the state of New Hampshire due to data quality concerns. Some state regulations were first passed long before the time-frame covered by our data (such as California's 1918 regulation on wastewater reuse). We elected to create a category for observations with greater than ten years of treatment to allow this information's inclusion in analyses where it is relevant.
